# NLP COVID-19 Research Papers
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to develop a tool that will text-mine the database of research articles to gain useful insights about COVID-19, how to improve vaccination efforts and how to better inform healthcare system to tackle the problem. This project involves:
 - Parsing and cleaning the dataset.
 - Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to get more insight on the COVID-19 research papers.
 - Using unsupervised machine learning algorithm (k-Means Clustering) to group related articles.
 - Assigning topics to clusters generated by k-Means using Latent Dirichlet Allocation Allocation (LDA) model.
